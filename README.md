## About the app

The BC Student Outcomes Data Viewer was created to be a simple, dynamic interface that allows users to view up-to-date student outcomes information (three years of aggregated data) from six Student Groups referenced as follows, under the Student Group drop-down menu: 

- Apprenticeship (includes Traditional and Progressive apprenticeship programs; public and private institutions are included in the Overall and Program Area results)
- Associate Degree (includes university transfer programs) 
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree
- Certificate (includes Post-degree Certificates and Advanced Certificates) 
- Diploma (includes Post-degree Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas) 
- Trades Foundation 

BC Student Outcomes results in the Data Viewer are available by Student Group, by Institution, by Program Area, and by Program Name. Aggregated data for the three most recent survey years are presented.  Note: For the Apprenticeship student group results, public and private institutions are included in the Overall and Program Area results.  For results by Institution and Program Level, only data for public institutions are available.

The data visualization tool is written in R, using the {shiny} package. The application is hosted at https://bcstats.shinyapps.io/so_data_viewer/
